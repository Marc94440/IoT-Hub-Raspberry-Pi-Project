On your Raspberry Pi or using SSH, first install the latest version of nodejs : 
```sh
curl -sL http://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash
sudo apt-get -y install nodejs

Then clone the repository in a folder named IoT_App in the Pi Desktop :

                                                                                                   

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Marc94440/IoT-Hub-Raspberry-Pi-Project Desktop/IoT_App                           
```
Now let's install all the necesorry packages :
